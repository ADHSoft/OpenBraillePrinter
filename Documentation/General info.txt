Looking for building a braille printer? (a.k.a. braille embosser)
Wanna make a cool school project?
Well, this is an electronic device you could build yourself.
Knowledge recommended: Have worked with microcontroller projects before. Ability to make simple electronic PCBs.
This project is something you can build easily build in less than one month, and get good results.


To build the Open Braille Printer, you'll need to:
Get an old (compatible) printer and take out its original circuits.
Build aproximately three specific PCBs following the schematics.

Install a push-pull solenoid, in place of the original printing head of the printer.
Shape the solenoid's tip to a small rounded piece, which will punch one dot at a time on the paper.
Lastly, upload the OBP firmware through usb to the controller and run it.
As the software is open source, you can adapt it and upgrade it to your needs, or to match other printers mechanisms.

The OBP started as a simpler project for PIC, made for high school (it's like one of those "cool" arduino projects of today), but after graduating I kept improving it and I recoded it for the more powerful LPC hardware. The software has many months of hard work into, since it was used as a project for a Programming subject of my university.

------------

Some technical specifications: 
The code was made for the NXP Stick board ( LPC 1769 ).
Uses a modified Epson(C) LX-810 as the printer.

The previous version that started it all, coded for a PIC microcontroller, was uploaded too. (in another repository)

 L2 ; L3 ; L5 ; L1 : Horizontal stepping motor coils (single pole motor) ( the motor that moves the printing head )
 L7 ; L8 ; L6 ; L4 : Vertical stepping motor coils (single pole motor) ( the motor that moves the sheet )
 direct connection to LX810's motor. Could add protection diodes in antiparallel.
 These motors connect to the L293D circuit, which is controlled by the EXP6,7,9,8 and EXP12,13,15,14 respectively.
 Without using Infotronic Developer Board:
 EXP6= Port3[26]
 EXP7= Port1[25]
 EXP8= Port1[22]
 EXP9= Port1[19]
 EXP12=Port1[27]
 EXP13=Port1[24]
 EXP14=Port1[21]
 EXP15=Port1[18]
 
 
 MARTILLO (HAMMER) :  Solenoidal Coil that pushes a single dot printing metal piece.
 Using infotronic: Connect to RELAY3
 Without Infotronic: Connect to a relay circuit that delivers enough power to the coil (example, 12v 3a) and it's controlled by Port0[27]
 
 SENSOR_PAPEL (paper sensor) : direct connection to LX810's paper switch
 Using infotronic : Connect to ED1 (Entrada Digital 0)
 Without Infotronic: Connect to Port4[29] and ground
 
 SENSOR_Fin_Carro (head position sensor) : direct connection to LX810's position switch
 Using infotronic : Connect to ED2 (Entrada Digital 0)
 Without Infotronic: Connect to Port2[11] and ground
 
 TECLADO (Keyboard) : Any Computer keyboard with a PS/2 interface/connector .
 CLK Pin :
 Using infotronic : Connect to EXP5
 Without Infotronic: Connect to Port0[19]
 DATA Pin:
 Using infotronic : Connect to EXP0
 Without Infotronic: Connect to Port2[7]
 
 Audio Out: Using Headphones without amplifier (possibly dangerous? for the LPC if it draws too much current):
 Using infotronic : Connect headphones between ground and BR11 Connector, with a 104 capacitor in series. on the H1 jumper connect 2&3.
 Without Infotronic: Connect headphones between ground and "P0[26] ADO0.3/AOUT" pin , with a 104 capacitor in series.
 (capacitor could be optional, maybe?)
 
 Audio Out: Using a speaker :
 Using infotronic : Connect speaker between ground and BR11 Connector ; with H1 jumper connect 2&1 to enable the amplifier circuit, and adjust the volume potentiometer.
 Without Infotronic: Make or copy the amplifier circuit for the speaker that receives the audio from the "P0[26] ADO0.3/AOUT" Pin.
 
 LCD Display: Connect a 2x16 generic lcd in place of LCDM1 , following the pdfs.
 
 PC Connection: 
 Using infotronic (UART0): The USB port is CN18
 Without Infotronic: Use a USB to serial circuit to UART0 (or to UART1 modifying the code).
 
 VCC = 5v
